# ZorkLib
C++ Wrapper Library for WinAPI, Direct2D, GUIs and often used functionality. Quick and easy to use.  
This library is work in progress and may change existing parts. Developed using Visual Studio 2019.

#### Features
* ZorkLib/Window 
	* Create a Window that provides a KeyDown, MouseDown framework with simplified Direct2D rendering. Allows access to underlying functionality.
* ZorkLibUSB
	* Easier access to USB devices using **libusb**. Supports opening device via VID, PID, Serial Number. Writing and reading data through control and bulk transactions.
* ZorkLib/Utility
	* Utility functions such as getting files from a directory, or string manipulation.

#### Requirements
* Windows (preferably 10)
* for ZorkLibUSB: [libusb](https://github.com/libusb/libusb)

#### Future Plans
* Integration of [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).
* Sound using XAudio2.
* Anything that is frequently used and has to be programmed again or copied over.

#### Limitations
* Because of the direct usage of WinAPI and DirectX, this library only works on Windows. Ports to other platforms is unlikely.
* Code is unfinished and often a mess ;)
* Much functionality is still missing.
* Some things may be designed poorly and will be reworked when it becomes a problem.

#### Example

	#include <ZorkLib.hpp>
	#include <ZorkLibWindow.hpp>
	
	void OnMouseEvent(UINT32 key, INT32 x, INT32 y, bool down) {
		// Triggered on all mouse buttons presses / releases. (LBUTTON, RBUTTON, MBUTTON, X1, X2)
	}
	
	void OnKeyEvent(UINT32 key, bool down) {
		// Triggered when a keyboard button was pressed or released.
	}
	
	void Render(ZorkLib::SimpleRenderer& sr) {
		sr.Fill(ZorkLib::ColorEnum::White);
	}
	
	int main() {
    
		ZorkLib::Window window(L"Example");
		window.SetSimpleRenderFunction(Render);
		window.SetKeyEventFunction(OnKeyEvent);
		window.SetMouseEventFunction(OnMouseEvent);
        
        // This function will run and call framework methods until exit condition is met. (Default: When escape key is pressed)
		window.WindowLoop();
        
	}
